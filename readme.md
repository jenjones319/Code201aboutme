## About Me

I am currently a programmer in the manufacturing industry and a student at Delta V Code in the software development program. I am currently in the Code 201 class. 

I have a large house hold with a girlfriend, 5 kids and 2 dogs. I enjoy archery and coaching a youth archery team that includes kids from 3rd grade up through seniors for school age as well as adults. I also shoot competitive archery in a little free time I may have left. I have also qualified for a world 3d archery tournament in my shooting adventures. 

I met my girlfriend around 5 years ago and started dating 4 years ago. We as well as our 5 children (3 are hers, 2 are mine, all are ours) have lived together in Central City for a little over 2-1/2 years. 

I love manufacturing, making and doing. I have a nac and obsession with process streamlining and automation. I hope to take everything I learn at Delta V and apply it to the digital manufacturing world.
