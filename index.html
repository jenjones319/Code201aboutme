                        important than you think. I grew up and have lived my entire life in Iowa 
                        and dont really have any problems with that.

                        <p class="family-styles"> I have a girlfriend and I have 2 children and she has 3,
                            together we have 5 kids, 4 boys and 1 girl and 2 dogs, a Pitsky named Brad, yes its 
                            Brad Pitsky and a Yorkiepoo named otter. He is free to any good home if someone is willing to 
                            take the barkbox off my hands and not tell my youngest son.

                        <p class="work-styles"> I grew up working in my family's motorcycle shop they owned for almost 60 years.
                            I started taking care of the property and washing motorcyles when I was 12, I left there to learn
                            how to be a machinist and worked my way into programming CNC machines and entry level design. It was there
                            I learned to love automation and software programming.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <p class="edu-styles"> My first formal post high school training was Tech school where I went for General machinist
                            and worked for years using my new skill until a work related injury sent me back to sales.  I worked at J7P Cycles
                            for over 6 years until getting back into manufacturing, not before going to Kirkwood to give their new "advanced" 
                            curriculum, only to have that fail for me. After that I took a series of work related training certs to bring
                            me where I am today at Delta V Code in the 201 class
